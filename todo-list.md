## To-Do

4. [ ] Make resume pretty by re-doing it in the online maker.
5. [ ] Re-share the resume with Angie.

## Doing

1. [ ] Publish individual site for each portfolio page except blog.

- [X] Make a list of the pages I want to publish.
  - Clinical Impression App
  - Friendly Reminder
  - Natours (choose a new name)
- [X] Do a 5 minute brainstorm about the things I want to say in the page: Which
  questions do I want to answer?
  - Which technologies or skills did I use? What features does the page or app have?
    - Natours:
      - CSS: flexbox
      - SASS
      - Card elements?
      - BEM
      - Cool modal with just CSS (no JS!)
    - EANT project (node)
      - Node
      - Express
      - Deployed to Netlify and Mongo Atlas
      - MongoDB native driver
      - Bcrypt for encryption
      - JWTs and Cookies for sessions.
  - Link to GH.
- [X] Make the html structure of the site.
  - Sketch it out on the whiteboard.
  - Write the HTML.
- Answer the questions in each page.
- Add a screen-shot in each page.
- Add links to the actual site and the GitHub project.

- [ ] Create a redirect to make sure that blog.johnsciutto.com goes to my blog.
  - bug: run into an issue with SSL certificates. I need to have a "*"
    certificate to cover all the sub-domains, and I don't have that.

## Done

- [X] Make buttons into proper components
  - [X] Change CSS styles to make sure that it looks the way I want to.
- [X] Test idea: What if I set a negative z-index for the header and footer,
    and then just skewed the main section of the site and counter-skew the
    children. That might work to make the edges more aligned without having to
    play so much with the top and bottom clip-path.
- [X] Edit buttons in unordered list to look like little pills that are horizontal.
- [X] Fill out all descriptions.
- [X] Go description by description highlighting all the key words
      (frameworks, skills and libraries).
- [X] Create navigation buttons for small header.
- [X] Create an outline with a grid.
- [X] Make new HTML file
- [X] Link CSS and JS
- [X] Create 3 sections (header, main and footer)
- [X] Copy and paste the header and the footer form the index
- [X] Create 3 mock cards
- [X] Place the 3 mock cards horizontally on the grid
- [X] Try skewing the main section and then counterskewing the children to
      see how it looks
- [X] Link the portfolio page in the index
- [X] Add navigation links to home and certifications in the footer
- [X] Add the footer links to the footer in the portfolio page.
- [X] Edit the styles of the footer links.
- [X] Finish media queries for Home (5) { est: 30min, act: 2h19min }
- [X] Finish media queries for Portfolio
- [X] Finish media queries for Certifications (2) { est: 20min; act: 13min }
- [X] Add the compiled files to the server (1) { exp: 5min; act: 5min }
- [X] Fix image positioning inconsistent online and in development. Maybe cut
      an copy of the image and present it as a srcset for a different size?
- [X] Check to see if I have a Netlify blog working.  
      { expected: 3min; start: 11:44, end: 11:45, actual:1}
- [X] Create a blog using Netlify and Hugo.
- [X] Link my blog from my main site.
- [X] Link my blog from my portfolio site.
- [X] Add link to my blog from top flat navigation in "certifications"
- [X] Add link to my blog from footer navigation in all pages.
- [X] Test the blog by publishing one article directly from VSCode using git.
- [X] Create a resume single page up on Netlify, linked from my GitHub.
- [X] Create a schedule to write/publish posts. { expected: 1hs , actual: 1hs}
- [X] Plan out the stories for my Clinical Impressions App. { estimated:
      25min, actual: 41min }
- [X] Change portfolio card buttons so that they are in the "same container",
      side by side. The github icon to the very right.
