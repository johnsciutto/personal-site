## Done

- [X] Make buttons into propper compnents
  - [X] Change CSS styles to make sure that it looks the way I want to.
- [X] Test idea: What if I set a negative z-index for the header and footer,
    and then just skewed the main section of the site and counter-skew the
    children. That might work to make the edges more aligned without having to
    play so much with the top and bottom clip-path.
- [X] Edit buttons in ul to look like little pills that are horizontal.
- [X] Fill out all descriptions.

      (frameworks, skills and libraries).

- [X] Create an outline with a grid.
- [X] Make new HTML file

- [X] Create 3 sections (header, main and footer)

- [X] Create 3 mock cards

      see how it looks
