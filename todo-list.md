# To-Do List for Personal Site

- [X] Make buttons into propper compnents
  - [X] Change CSS styles to make sure that it looks the way I want to.

## Portfolio

- [ ] Do the media queries for the "portfolio" site.
- [ ] Test idea: What if I set a negative z-index for the header and footer,
    and then just skewed the main section of the site and counter-skew the
    children. That might work to make the edges more aligned without having to
    play so much with the top and bottom clip-path.

## Blog

- [ ] Check to see if I have a Netlify blog working.
- [ ] Read about how to link my blog to a custom subdomain created in cPanel
      (goDaddy hosting).
- [ ] Link my blog from my main site.
- [ ] Link my blog from my portfolio site.
- [ ] Add link to my blog from top flat navigation in "certifications"
- [ ] Add link to my blog from footer navigation in all pages.
- [ ] Create a schedule to write/publish posts.
- [ ] Test the blog by publishing one article directly from VSCode using git.
- [ ] Assess where I am and create more to-do's if necessary.

## Later

- [ ] Certifications Page: Add fixed round button with up pointing arrow in
      bottom right corner to navigate up.
