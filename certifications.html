          Reviewed the basics of <strong>HTML, CSS and web design</strong>.
          Then dove into <strong>Javascript</strong>, and
          <strong>Node</strong>. It was my first exposure to
          <strong>React</strong> and to <strong>MongoDB</strong>. Became
          proficient creating <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> and implementing
          <strong> authentication with bcrypt and OAuth 2.0 </strong>
          (although I later learned how to use the <strong>OpenID</strong>
          standard for this, and leave OAuth 2.0 for authorization instead of
          authentication).</p>

        <p class="course-card__description">Another fairly complete 50+ hour
          course. This is the course that I used to first learn <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It
          dives quite deeply into the basics, and then moves onto <strong>
            asynchronous JS </strong> (in this course I learned how to
          properly use promises and async/await). I learned how to use
          <strong>SVGs</strong> and the <strong>Canvas API</strong> with
          the <strong>MatterJS</strong> library. On the NodeJS side of the
          project, I learned how to <strong>create CLI tools</strong> using
          JavaScript. In this course I also learned some of the basics of
          <strong>database design, user authentication and
            testing</strong>. I learned how some testing frameworks are built
          by building a basic testing framework from scratch.</p>

        <p class="course-card__author">Anthony Alicea - Udemy</p>
        <p class="course-card__description">This was a fantastic course. In it I
          learned a lot about how JS works behind the scenes, and some <strong>
            advanced JS concepts </strong>. I learned about how scope works
          in JS (both with the var keyword and the let and const keywords),
          how closures work. What prototypal inheritance is and how it
          works... I learned a lot. But I think the most important thing I
          learned was how to learn by reading the source code of well used
          frameworks and libraries.</p>

        <p class="course-card__description">In this course I learned a lot of more
          <strong>advanced JS concepts</strong>. It's a great compliment to
          the "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts" course. I reviewed
          what I knew about hoisting, execution context, lexical environment,
          the scope chain, etc. This course also introduced me to <strong>
            functional programming </strong> in JS, and how to do better
          <strong>error handling in asynchronous code</strong>.</p>

        <p class="course-card__description">This was a fantastic course by James
          Moore. I fell in love with <strong>functional programming</strong>. I
          learned about the principles behind functional programming and how to
          apply them to JS. I learned about <strong>currying and partial
            application</strong>, and <strong> function composition</strong>. I
          also learned a lot of using the <strong>MVP pattern</strong> to
          structure small functional applications.</p>

          websites. Designing is not my strong-suite, and this course gave me

        <p class="course-card__author">Colt Steele - Udemy</p>
        <p class="course-card__description">This was a great course. It was my
          first introduction to what <strong>algorithms and data
            structures</strong> were. In this course I learned 6 <strong>sorting
            algorithms</strong>, different ways of <strong> solving problems
          </strong>, and how to write different <strong>data
            structures</strong> in JS using the "class" syntax. I also learned
          about <strong> Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm </strong> and how
          to write it in JS. But most importantly, I discovered the genius of
          Dijkstra and ignited my interest for reading more about him and other
          pioneers of computer science.</p>

        <p class="course-card__description">This was a fairly good course. I
          didn't learn a lot of new things form it, but it helped me find
          <strong>different approaches to solving problems and writing data
            structures</strong> in JS. My biggest takeaway form the course was
          learning how to use the "two pointer" pattern for problem solving
          in novel ways (for example, to find the length of a linked list
          without having a reference of it's tail; or to figure out if the
          linked list is circular or not). This blew my mind.</p>

          knowledge of data structures, particularly of hash tables, trees
